		To be, or not to be- (space) that is the question: (line)
		Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer (line)
		The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune (line)
		Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, (line)
		And by opposing end them. To die- (space) to sleep- (line)
		No more; and by a sleep to say we end (line)
		The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks (line)
		That flesh is heir to. ’Tis a consummation (line)
		Devoutly to be wish’d. To die- (space) to sleep. (line)
		To sleep- (space) perchance to dream: ay, there’s the rub! (line)
		For in that sleep of death what dreams may come (line)
		When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, (line)
		Must give us pause. There’s the respect (line)
		That makes calamity of so long life.

		For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, (line)
		Th’ oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely, (line)
		The pangs of despis’d love, the law’s delay, (line)
		The insolence of office, and the spurns (line)
		That patient merit of th’ unworthy takes, (line)
		When he himself might his quietus make (line)
		With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear, (line)
		To grunt and sweat under a weary life, (line)
		But that the dread of something after death- (line)
		The undiscover’d country, from whose bourn (line)
		No traveller returns- (space) puzzles the will, (line)
		And makes us rather bear those ills we have (line)
		Than fly to others that we know not of? (line)
		Thus conscience does make cowards of us all, (line)
		And thus the native hue of resolution (line)
		Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought, (line)
		And enterprises of great pith and moment (line)
		With this regard their currents turn awry (line)
		And lose the name of action.- (space) Soft you now! (line)
		The fair Ophelia!- (space) Nymph, in thy orisons (line)
		Be all my sins rememb’red.

		Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature, I ought to by thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. The desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many days. The caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the only one which man does not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings. If the multitude of mankind knew of my existence, they would do as you do and arm themselves for my destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me?

		Ruth!—Elvira!—I know damn well you’re there. I just want to tell you that I’m going away, so there’s no point in your hanging about any longer—I’m going a long way away—somewhere where I don’t believe you’ll be able to follow me—in spite of what Elvira said I don’t think spirits can travel over water. Is that quite clear, my darlings? You said in one of your more acid moments, Ruth, that I had been hag-ridden all my life! How right you were! But now I’m free, Ruth dear, not only of Mother and Elvira and Mrs. Winthrop-Llewellyn, but free of you too, and I should like to take this farewell opportunity of saying I’m enjoying it immensely— 
		Aha! I thought so. You were very silly, Elvira, to imagine that I didn’t know all about you and Captain Bracegirdle. I did. But what you didn’t know was that I was extremely attached to Paula Westlake at the time! I was reasonably faithful to you, Ruth, but I doubt if it would have lasted much longer. You were becoming increasingly domineering, you know, and there’s nothing more off-putting than that, is there? Goodbye for the moment, my dears! I expect we are bound to meet again one day, but until we do I’m going to enjoy myself as I’ve never enjoyed myself before. You can break up the house as much as you like—I’m leaving it anyhow. Think kindly of me, and send out good thoughts. Nice work, Ruth—get Elvira to help you...persevere! Goodbye! Parting is such sweet sorrow!

		Now my charms are all o’erthrown, (line)
		And what strength I have ’s mine own, (line)
		Which is most faint. Now ’tis true (line)
		I must be here confined by you, (line)
		Or sent to Naples. Let me not, (line)
		Since I have my dukedom got (line)
		And pardoned the deceiver, dwell (line)
		In this bare island by your spell, (line)
		But release me from my bands (line)
		With the help of your good hands. (line)
		Gentle breath of yours my sails (line)
		Must fill, or else my project fails, (line)
		Which was to please. Now I want (line)
		Spirits to enforce, art to enchant, (line)
		And my ending is despair, (line)
		Unless I be relieved by prayer, (line)
		Which pierces so that it assaults (line)
		Mercy itself, and frees all faults. (line)
		As you from crimes would pardoned be, (line)
		Let your indulgence set me free.

		God! God! God! (bullet) crack my heart! (bullet) stave my brain! (bullet) mockery! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of grey hairs, have I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus intolerably old? Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into a human eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to gaze upon God. By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is the magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye. No, no; stay on board, on board! (bullet) lower not when I do; when branded Ahab gives chase to Moby Dick. That hazard shall not be thine. No, no! not with the far away home I see in that eye!

		I know what’s going on here. I know what’s going on here. Okay? I do. And if you want me to wander backstage to spill the beans... I’m the only one out of the loop, it would seem...and if we check my point total here—I don’t NEED to walk to the front, because I know what it is. It’s a big ol’ GOOSE EGG, GANG. It’s a FAT ZERO. HELLO!! A little LATE ADDITION to the numerical symbol chart brought to us from our friends in Arabia, a little bit of trivia that I happen to know about the history of numbers. That kind of little tidbit would serve me well in most trivia games, unless it had been RIGGED FROM THE BEGINNING! Oh, I’ve only just BEGUN to pull the thread on this sweater, friends. You would THINK in a game where there are only TWO possible correct choices, that one would STUMBLE INTO the right answer every so often, wouldn’t you? In fact, the probability of NEVER guessing right in the full game is a STATISTICAL WONDER, and yet, HERE WE ARE. Introduced at the top of the game as a champion, what do you think that means? Icarus, flying too close to the sun. But it seems Daedalus, our little master crafter over here, had some wax wings of his own, didn’t he? Wanted to see his son fall. Fall from the sky. Oh, how CLOSE TO THE SUN he flew! Well I’m NOT HAVING IT. I solved your labyrinth, puzzle master! The minotaur’s escaped and you’re gonna get the horns, buddy! I CANNOT WIN!

		You pretended envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to and from Jupiter Tonans; you mere man who come here to put you and your pipestem between clay and sky, do you think that because you can strike a bit of green light from the Leyden jar, that you can thoroughly avert the supernal bolt? Your rod rusts, or breaks, and where are you? Who has empowered you, you Tetzel, to peddle round your indulgences from divine ordinations? The hairs of our heads are numbered, and the days of our lives. In thunder as in sunshine, I stand at ease in the hands of my God. False negotiator, away! See, the scroll of the storm is rolled back; the house is unharmed; and in the blue heavens I read in the rainbow, that the Deity will not, of purpose, make war on man’s earth. Begone! move quickly! if quickly you can, you that shine forth into sight in moist times like the worm.

		Oh, friend John, it is a strange world, a sad world, a world full of miseries, and woes, and troubles; and yet when King Laugh come he make them all dance to the tune he play. Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and tears that burn as they fall—all dance together to the music that he make with that smileless mouth of him. And believe me, friend John, that he is good to come, and kind. Ah, we men and women are like ropes drawn tight with strain that pull us different ways. Then tears come; and, like the rain on the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strain become too great, and we break. But King Laugh he come like the sunshine, and he ease off the strain again; and we bear to go on with our labour, what it may be.

		Poor children, how they loathe me – me whose hands are certainly steeped  in infamy, but whose heart is as the heart of a little child!  But what is a poor baronet  to do, when a whole picture gallery of ancestors step down from their frames and  threaten him with an excruciating death if he hesitate to commit his daily crime?  But haha! I am even with them!  I get my crime over the first thing in the morning, and then, haha! For the rest of the day I do good – I do good – I do good! Two days since, I stole a child and built an orphan asylum. Yesterday I robbed a bank and endowed a bishopric. Today I carry off Rose Maybud and atone with a cathedral! This is what it is to be the sport and toy of a Picture Gallery! But I will be bitterly revenged upon them! I will give them all to the Nation, and nobody shall ever look upon their faces again!

		I boarded the king’s ship; now on the beak, (line)
		Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin, (line)
		I flamed amazement: sometime I’d divide, (line)
		And burn in many places; on the topmast, (line)
		The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly, (line)
		Then meet and join. Jove’s lightnings, the precursors (line)
		O’ the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary (line)
		And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks (line)
		Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune (line)
		Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble, (line)
		Yea, his dread trident shake.

		Nay, such is the vividness of my memory, or the magic of my fancy, that I know not whether I am not the occasional victim of optical delusion concerning the Gallipagos. For, often in scenes of social merriment, and especially at revels held by candlelight in old-fashioned mansions, so that shadows are thrown into the further recesses of an angular and spacious room, making them put on a look of haunted undergrowth of lonely woods, I have drawn the attention of my comrades by my fixed gaze and sudden change of air, as I have seemed to see, slowly emerging from those imagined solitudes, and heavily crawling along the floor, the ghost of a gigantic tortoise, with “Memento \*\*\*\*\*” burning in live letters upon his back.
